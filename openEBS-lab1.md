Understand the pre-requisites for your Kubernetes platform
Start installation through OpenEBS operator.
For production deployments or to test OpenEBS volumes on real disks, create cStorPools, cStor-StorageClasses and start provisioning volumes using the newly created cStor-StorageClasses. More details can be found from here.
For applications requiring high performance, which manage their own replication, data protection and other storage features, provision OpenEBS Local PV. More details can be found here.
